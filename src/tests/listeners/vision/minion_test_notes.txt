Final test, using 100 random images from ingame
True positives: 363
False positives: 0
False negatives: 19
Precision: 100.00%
Recall: 95.03%

General strategy to detect the health bar:
Create a binary image depending on whether pixel color is near minion's health bar edge color.
Then, use template matching to find the health bars (1 on outline, 0 inside).
Finally, manually check pixel colors using binary search to figure out the minion's side and health.

Minion health bar is reused for the honeyfruit, with different health color
Blast cone also reuses the same health bar, with differnet health color
Control ward health bar is the same size, gets detected incorrectly
Same as above for stealth ward
Health bars are partially reused for jungle monsters, different sizes maybe, get detected wrongly
Health bars also appear to be reused for stuff like turrets, Shaco boxes, etc.

False positive on the top part of the Q ability box
False positive all along the bottom gui display
False positive between the "2" and "3" in the gui display
False positives along edge when pressing tab
False positives all over the client GUI
False positive in the death recap
False positive along bottom of turret health bar
False positive along top of player health bar
False positive on ability description tooltip
False positive on ability chargeup display
So basically GUI causes a ton of false positives with 0% health (no inside color detected), maybe filter those out?

Now filtering out the above false positives:

FALSE NEGATIVE - \screenshots\blindpick\ingame\frame_291.png
FALSE NEGATIVE - \screenshots\beginnerbot\ingame\frame_617.png
FALSE NEGATIVE - \screenshots\beginnerbot\ingame\frame_545.png

False negatives are caused by the program thinking that the inside right hand part is the same color as edge of health bar
